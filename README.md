- Instructions for this assignment were to make a simple website (usually with Wix or Weebly) containing information about different organism kingdoms.
- I wanted to learn more Django and be an overachiever. *This was a mistake.*

### Notes:
- I grew by learning how to create a Django image type model and implement it within Html/template language.
- Research was 50% split with partner
- All-nighters: 1
- Images don't load on pythonanywhere some reason. I must've messed up my static file setup.
